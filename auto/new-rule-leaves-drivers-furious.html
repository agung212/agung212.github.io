						<p> <b>Are you being scammed by your current insurer? New policies are indicating that for years many drivers have been overpaying on their car insurance.</b></p>
						<p>(<script type="text/javascript">document.write( geoip_region_name() );</script>): This is the 1 truth your car insurance company doesn't want you to know. If you're <strong>driving less than 45 miles per day</strong> on average and live in a qualified zip code you can get some huge discounts. In addition, if you have no DUI's on your record, you can get even more discounts. Has your car insurance company ever told you that? And these aren't the only money saving tricks, yet it remains very difficult to find a truely good deal on auto insurance. </p>
						<p>When drivers enter their zip code at <a href="./insurance.php" style="color:#0000FF;">GetMyInsurance.com</a> many are shocked at the results they find. Most just cannot believe that the available rates are in fact real, but the truth is rates have dropped significantly over the past 12 months and thanks to new program policies<strong> it's now easy to save up to 65% or more with rates as low as $27/month.</strong></p>
						<p><strong>So, what is the &quot;One Simple Rule?&quot;</strong> NEVER buy car insurance without comparing all of the discounts available to you through an unbiased source. Up until now this has been nearly impossible to do manually...</p>
						<p>Luckily there are now new web app tools to help you achieve your lowest rate possible. <strong>Sarah Reed, the Authority on insurance savings</strong>, tested this new secure web app to see if it lived up to the hype. It was so easy to use, she ran 3 peoples quotes in 10 minutes and reached an average savings of $578 per year for each customer. Sarah then used this secure web app called <a href="./insurance.php" style="color:#0000FF;">GetMyInsurance.com</a> for her own car insurance, and saved even more.</p>
						<p>Based on these findings it is evident that the only way to get the discounted rates you deserve is to take matters into your own hands. Smart consumers already know this, and as a rule, are now choosing to use online tools to receive unbiased insurance quotes fast and hassle free.</p>
						<p><span style="background-color:#FFFF00; "><em><strong>NOTE: You're NEVER LOCKED into your current policy.</strong> If you've already paid  your current policy, you can very easily cancel  and  the balance will be refunded.</em></span> </p>
						<p><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="./insurance.php"><font color="red">Click this screenshot here to try it yourself:</font></a></span><br /></p>
						<a href="./insurance.php" style="color:#0000FF;"><img src="img/screenshot_z19.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px;"></a>
						<p>The big question is: how does this technology help you save more money than your agent? The problem is that agents don't want to find you the best deal, because the more you pay, the more they make. Now, you can contact multiple companies instantaneously online, giving you several "quotes" for the same level of coverage. You can avoid agent fees by finding the cheapest price yourself. </p>
						<p>That way, consumers keep more money in their pocket, saving an average of 45% per year. ComScore's 2012 U.S. Online Auto Insurance Shopping Report recommends that more people take advantage of secure services like <a href="./insurance.php" style="color:#0000FF;">GetMyInsurance.com</a>. There's no login required and no fee: simply <a href="./insurance.php" style="color:#0000FF;"> click here</a> to enter your zip code, fill out your basic information, and start saving money.</p>

			<p>*Clarification of the advertising headline &quot;New Rule in <script type="text/javascript">
				document.write( geoip_region_name() );
				</script>&quot;. - Merriam-Webster's Dictionary defines the word &quot;rule&quot; as &quot;a piece of advice about the best way to do something&quot; (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rule). This article aims to advise the public that comparing rates is one of the best ways that you can save money on car insurance. No matter what city, state or zip code you live in you can compare rates and get free quotes. If you truly want to find the best rate and save on car insurance then follow our advice or &quot;rule&quot; to compare rates. Here are links to two surveys which demonstrate the importance of comparing rates and how applying this &quot;rule&quot; in any state, city or zip code can help drivers save 32% and $368 per year. A new survey found that the #1 reason people switch is because they found a cheaper rate. <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/car-insurance-why-do-people-switch.aspx" target="_blank">Click Here for Survey</a>. A second survey which analyzed car insurance quotes for 1,000 zip codes across the U.S. found that within a given zip code, rates vary by 154% on average, allowing drivers to find an average of 32% and $368 per year in savings. <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/2013/11/01/drivers-overpay-368-car-insurance-year/" target="_blank">Link Here For Survey.</a></p>
